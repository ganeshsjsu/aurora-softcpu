# SoftCPU-16 Software CPU

SoftCPU-16 is a teaching-oriented 16-bit software CPU that couples a small yet expressive ISA with an emulator, assembler, and example programs. The project demonstrates how a CPU can be specified, simulated, and programmed end-to-end using modern C++20.

```

## Building

Requirements: Clang or GCC with C++20 support and `make`.

```
make            # builds the `softcpu` CLI
make clean      # removes artifacts
```

## CLI usage

```
./softcpu assemble programs/hello.asm -o build/hello.bin
./softcpu run build/hello.bin --origin 0x0000 --entry 0x0000 --trace
./softcpu dump build/hello.bin --origin 0x0000 --start 0x0000 --length 64
```
